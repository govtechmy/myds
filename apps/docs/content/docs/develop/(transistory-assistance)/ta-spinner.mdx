## Automated Testing Tools

Automated accessibility testing tools help catch issues early in the development process. While they can't replace manual testing, they provide a first line of defense against common accessibility problems.


### ESLint Plugin: jsx-a11y
The jsx-a11y ESLint plugin provides static analysis for accessibility rules on JSX elements, catching issues before your code even runs.

**Key Features**
- Static AST checking for accessibility rules
- Integrated into our ESLint configuration
- Enforces best practices at development time

**Implementation**

```jsx
// In your ESLint configuration
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    // ... other extensions
    'plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended', // [!code highlight]
  ],
  plugins: [
    // ... other plugins
    'jsx-a11y', // [!code highlight]
  ],
  rules: {
    // You can customize specific rules
    'jsx-a11y/aria-role': 'error',
    'jsx-a11y/img-redundant-alt': 'warn',
  }
};
```
### Storybook: a11y-addon

For documented components, we use Storybook's accessibility addon to perform runtime accessibility testing.

**Key Features**
- Integrates axe-core for comprehensive testing
- Provides visual feedback in the Storybook UI
- Tests components in different states and variants

### VS Code: axe Accessibility Linter

The axe Accessibility Linter extension for VS Code helps identify accessibility issues during development with real-time feedback.

**Key Features**
- Provides real-time feedback in your editor
- Highlights accessibility issues with detailed explanations
- Complements ESLint with more detailed guidance

**Testing Tips**
- Install the extension via VS Code marketplace
- Look for highlighted issues in your JSX/TSX files
- Hover over issues for detailed explanations and fix suggestions
