## Introduction

As more people use digital government services, it’s important to keep them high-quality and accessible. The **Malaysia Government Design System (MYDS)** helps by providing a set of standard tools and templates, making it easier for agencies to create fast, user-friendly, and consistent digital services.

MYDS is essential because it aims to improve how Malaysians access government services. By using MYDS guidelines, agencies can build websites that are simple to use and show values like transparency, inclusivity, and efficiency.

## What is MYDS?

- **Components:** Pre-built elements like buttons, forms, and navigation bars that make building interfaces easier and more consistent across government websites.
- **Theme Customizer:** A tool to adjust colours and styles to match agency’s branding while maintaining a unified look and feel.
- **Patterns:** Ready-to-use layouts and design patterns that ensure best practices and usability in common interface scenarios, like login screens or data forms.
- **Design File:** A comprehensive design file that includes all assets, components, and guidelines, allowing designers to prototype and build efficiently in alignment with MYDS standards.

## Why use MYDS?

- **Consistency:** By using a unified design system, all government digital platforms will have a cohesive look and feel, which helps build trust and recognition among citizens.
- **Rapid development:** Efficiently streamline design and development with pre-built visual and functional elements, reusable components, and clear guidelines for prototyping.
- **Focus on user experience:** Spend less time styling and more effort to designing better user experience.
- **Scalability:** UI components can be customized to fit your specific needs.
- **Accessibility for all:** Prioritize inclusivity by following WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards to ensure that all citizens, regardless of their abilities, can easily access and navigate government services.

## Use cases for MYDS

- **Government Agency Websites:** Sites that share important information about government policies, regulations, and resources, including ministry profile, activities, achievements, announcements, media, and more.
- **Dashboard and Portals:** Create interactive dashboards for visualizing key metrics and user-friendly portals that allow citizens to easily access and manage various government services.
